here we extract methods specialized to lists of characters. *)

Definition matcher := lazy_regex_match ascii Ascii.ascii_dec.

Extraction Language Ocaml.

(** These directives cause the ascii datatype in Coq (which is just 8 booleans)
to be extracted to a native char. Taken from Software Foundations Imp
